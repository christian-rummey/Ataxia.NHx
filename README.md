## PSM Matching: Analyses that provide Context

**1) year-to-year change predictability.R**

-   computes adjacent 1-year annualized changes (prior year vs. subsequent year).

-   fits regressions to check if prior-year change predicts subsequent-year change.

-   stats (slope, R², correlation, p) + scatterplots with identity line and LM fit. -\> year-to-year change is noisy, slopes near zero → regression-to-the-mean dominates.

**2) year-to-year change predictability.R**

-   not cleaned
